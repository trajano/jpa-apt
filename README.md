JPA Annotation Processor
========================

Annotation processor that create support classes for JPA annotated classes.

## Table Module
The processor creates a Stateless Session Bean that represents the 
[table module][1] class.  The [table module design pattern][1] represents 
a single instance that handles the business logic for all rows in a 
database table or view.

In the traditional design pattern, a [table module][1] represents a single
model; as generated by this processor, the [table module][1] represents a
single entity graph that may span one or more tables.

The generated class provides support for CRUD operations via 

* `save(EntityType)` which creates or updates an entity
* `remove(EntityType)` which removes an entity from the database
* `getById(EntityIdType)` which reads a single entity from the database
 
In addition, it creates a new method for each `@NamedQuery` to ensure
the method is called correctly at compile time rather than at run-time.

For non-standard operations, any `public static` method that has an
`EntityManager` as it's first parameter will have a mapping in the
generated code where the entity manager is passed in.  Annotations are
not copied over for the non-standard operations.
